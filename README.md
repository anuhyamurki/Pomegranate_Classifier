# Pomegranate_Classifier
CNN Model which classifies pomegranate based on leaves images into one of the three categories namely BACTERIAL, FUNGAL or HEALTHY.
## Dataset
We are given the dataset having 238 images consisting of three folders -
i) 88 Healthy images
ii) 46 Fungal infected images
iii) 104 Bacterially infected images
We are supposed to build a model and train it on this dataset in such a way that given a new image of a leaf, the model should classify it into one of the three categories.
