# Pomegranate_Classifier
CNN Model which classifies pomegranate based on leaves images into one of the three categories namely BACTERIAL, FUNGAL or HEALTHY.
We are given the dataset having 238 images consisting of three folders -
i) 88 Healthy images
ii) 46 Fungal infected images
iii) 104 Bacterially infected images
We are supposed to build a model and train it on this dataset in such a way that given a new image of a leaf, the model should classify it into one of the three categories.
